#Refactoring is the process of taking already working code and then 
#Making it more modular by breaking up logic into re-useable pieces
#Remember that a function needs to have a clear and singular purpose
#Doing this allows us to refine the functions given their purpose
#Let's consider for example taking user input
#This is something that is done repeatedly, by making it into a function
#We are able to ensure that all of the requisite testing and exception
#Handling is completed for the function for each instance we use it.
